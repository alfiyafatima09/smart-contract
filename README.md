# 🎟️ Blockchain Ticketing System

Welcome to the **Blockchain Ticketing System**, a secure and efficient solution for issuing and verifying event tickets using blockchain technology. This system ensures each ticket is unique and tied to a specific user, preventing unauthorized transfers or duplications.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to create tamper-proof, non-transferable tickets for events. Tickets are issued as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) that are securely stored on the blockchain.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Unique Tickets**: Each ticket is an NFT with a unique ID.
- **Non-Transferable**: Tickets are SoulBound Tokens and cannot be transferred.
- **Secure Verification**: Organizers can verify ticket ownership on-chain.
- **Payment Integration**: Handles ticket purchases directly on the blockchain.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **OpenZeppelin**: Secure contract components.
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Tested on local and test networks.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before using this project, ensure you have:
- **Node.js**: Installed for managing dependencies.
- **Truffle/Hardhat**: For smart contract development.
- **MetaMask**: To interact with the blockchain.
- **Ganache/Testnet**: For local testing.
